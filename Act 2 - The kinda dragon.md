You is now a celebrity because of the Legendary Can of Tuna.

Sir Totally is the only person who is unamused by the legendary can.

Sir Totally only thinks of being in the role of The Chosen One. 

Sir Totally weilds a very expensive sword and has a decent amount of soldiers with him. 

Sir Totally has a quest of defeating the dragon.
He thought that the only way to get there is to get a mentor first (like Gandalf)

So he is finding a tall old person which is why he went to the village.

You met sir Totally on the road. 
"I, sir Totally, commanding you to lead us to a village"

You didnt care at first but he sees Sir Totally eats bread. 

You is tired of eggs and is in need of a new taste. 
You carelessly offer the legendary can.

Despite the huge offer. Sir Totally didnt care and continue to force You to lead his troops to the village.

They all reach the village and as a return, sir Totally gave You a bread.

blah blah 

You, sir Totally, the old guy and the soldiers finally reach the Cave of Tonkin - the dragon. 

sir Totally have lost most of his men. But he is certain he will defeat the dragon.

To their surprise, Tonkin the dragon, turns out to be just a giant mossy frog. 

Tonkin ate the old guy, killed the remaining soldiers and toss Totally's sword down the cliff.

You and sir Totally eventually defeated the giant frog.

sir Totally fulfilled his dream but at what cost.

sir Totally lose the expensive sword, a "mentor" guy and all his men. 

sir Totally gained a fear of frogs.
